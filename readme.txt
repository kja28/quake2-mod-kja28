At start, pick one of the 5 classes: Medic, Timemancer, Juggernaut, Nukeman, Assassin.  Each class has their own unique ability that you press 'E' to activate.  
The Medic heals rapidly to max, the timemancer stops enemies, the Juggernaut becomes invincible, Nukeman explodes that doesn't hurt him but kills everything around him, 
Assassin becomes invisible.  

Each time you kill an enemy they will drop random weapons with random stats. 

Some enemies are designed to behave motre like borderlands enemies.  Some will dodge more (bandits), some will just try to melee you (psychos),  
some will charge you really fast (principal gueardians), some will shoot a beam at you ( sera guardian), and some will spit acid (varkids).

The way weapons behave 

blaster/hyperblaster = fire rockets(torgue)

shotgun/super shotgun = fire as fast as you can click (jakob)

grenade launcher = explodes when dropped (Just throws a grenade) (Tediore)

rocket launcher = burst fire(dahl)

railgun = different outcomes each time

bfg = spawns clones of itself as it travels (similar to some powerful rocket launchers)

machineggun = gain precision while holding fire (Hyperion)

chaingun = has to charge up before it can fire (Vladof)
